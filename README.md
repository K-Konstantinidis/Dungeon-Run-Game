## Game Basics

The enemies appear randomly every time and except the ancient dragon, all the other enemies have random hp. 

After choosing your character, you will get __3__ free healing potions. 

Every time you fight, you have 3 options: 
- Attack
- Drink a healing potion 
- Run from the enemy. 

After ```fleeing successfully``` or ```killing the enemy```, you get to choose between ```continuing fighting``` in the dungeon or ```exiting``` the dungeon. 

Also every time you kill an enemy, there is a chance to find a healing potion. If the enemy was a dragon, then you will get a potion 100%.

You can __end__ the game by either exiting the dungeon or dying while fighting.
